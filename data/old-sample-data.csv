Livox is a pictogram-based alternative communication application that empowers people with a wide range of visual and motor impairments to engage in conversation. This project incorporated a ML and NLP-based classifier to detect specific questions and present the most relevant pictograms to users. Our newly introduced classifier reduced the time and effort required to communicate by 68.5% and 56.4%, respectively compared to the standard application. These results show that our work is a step forward towards making the world a more inclusive place for those who are nonverbal and have motor skill challenges.","<iframe width=""100%"" height=""315"" src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21269&amp;authkey=AK8SZ6a3G1PgniQ&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

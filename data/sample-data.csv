,,,,Elisa Negrini,"Luca Capogna Mathematical Sciences WPI, Giovanna Citti Mathematics University of Bologna","Mathematical Sciences, PhD",System Identification Through Lipschitz Regularized Deep Neural Networks,,"In this work we use neural networks to learn governing equations from data. Specifically, we reconstruct the right-hand side of a system of ODEs x'(t) = f(t, x(t)) directly from observed uniformly time-sampled data using a neural network. In contrast with other neural network-based approaches to this problem, we add a Lipschitz regularization term to our loss function. In the synthetic examples we show empirically that this regularization results in a smoother approximating function and better generalization properties when compared with non-regularized models, both on trajectory and non-trajectory data, especially in presence of noise.","<iframe src=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTv9oaYx3SRUlmos5ZUoPqrNQ2U8PhoqBE-dfzJsSL3bN0WBbdhzE4VaE-8YWSv4RpFG2VeO1LWx1CB/pub?embedded=true""></iframe>"
,,,,Elizabeth DiLoreto,,"Biology and Biotechnology, PhD",How Infection Alters the Brain,,"The connection between the gut microbiome and the brain is important for one’s wellbeing. The gut and its residents work to mount an immune response towards infections such as Staphylococcus aureus. To understand the connection between the brain and gut under stressors like infection, we must first understand how each component acts alone. The response of the gut in the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in infection is partially elucidated; the Wnt and muscarinic signaling pathways (involving the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) precede the release of antimicrobials in the gut in response to Staph infection. Yet, we don’t know how these signaling pathways initiate their responses and what role the brain plays in these pathways. My research tackles how the brain first detects the presence of infection, responds over the course of infection, and recovers after infection. This work will determine if infection causes any lasting effects on the brain’s structure and function.","<iframe src=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRSwL0rZADDHvm8NlDbKXqq_N8aFzzZtlAELpdsyNG78R5blY8J1yl9uiMN5bu90Q/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"" frameborder=""0"" width=""1280"" height=""749"" allowfullscreen=""true"" mozallowfullscreen=""true"" webkitallowfullscreen=""true""></iframe>"

,,,,Hannah Smith,Dr. Erin Ottmar,"Learning Sciences & Technologies, PhD",Rotation = Adaptation: How Mental Rotation Skills Can Make You a Better Mathematician,,"Spatial skills, specifically mental rotation skills, have been shown to positively predict math performance. In the current study, we examine the relations between mental rotation skills and math performance in an online geometry assignment. A total of 2,255 middle school students answered four mental rotation problems and then completed a problem set focused on geometric translations. We found that mental rotation skills predict assignment completion rates and mastery speed. Further, students with low mental rotation ability benefitted from viewing problems with a coordinate grid whereas students with high mental rotation ability were not impacted by the presence of a coordinate grid. These results replicate and extend prior research that mental rotation skills contribute to math performance in an online environment. More importantly, understanding how individual differences like spatial skills impact math performance can help us provide students with appropriate instructional support and inform the design of online problem sets.","<iframe width=""100%"" height=""315"" src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21269&amp;authkey=AK8SZ6a3G1PgniQ&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
,,,,Huaming Sun,Dr. Scarlet Shell and Dr. Dmitry Korkin,"Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, PhD",Using machine learning to understand the determinants of mRNA stability in mycobacteria,,"Tuberculosis is an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As a highly successful pathogen, M. tuberculosis is able to infect, survive and proliferate within harsh microenvironments created by human host. Regulation of both transcription and mRNA degradation are key for survival of the wide range of host defenses. Previous studies have shown that the stability of mRNA varies from gene to gene. There are also differences in the patterns of mRNA stability in different growth and stress conditions. A better understanding of the determinants of mRNA stability in M. tuberculosis will shed light on how it adapts to the harsh environments. Here we developed a computational pipeline to help us study the mechanisms of degradation. First, we performed RNASeq to quantify mRNAs degradation transcriptome-wide using the non-pathogenic model M. smegmatis. Next, through unsupervised machine learning, we clustered genes according to their mRNAs decay profiles. We then used random forest classifier to explore the mRNA features associated with different degradation patterns. The results show that instead of one dominant feature, various types of features including nucleotide, codon, secondary structure and other genomic features, all contribute to differentiate the degradation patterns. Our results also demonstrate that the determinants of decay pattern are different for mRNAs from leadered and leaderless genes.","<iframe src=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQeBLwBMnJ7YDbDcA3ze2jXoIPvWPPk34tWlEcqb58s-5h7HDIc13P0DXInapdIzQ/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"" frameborder=""0"" width=""1280"" height=""749"" allowfullscreen=""true"" mozallowfullscreen=""true"" webkitallowfullscreen=""true""></iframe>"
,,,,Julia Martin,Dr. Ron Grimm,"Chemistry and Biochemistry, PhD","Strategies Toward Inexpensive, Efficient, and Scalable Solar Energy",,"Highly efficient, inexpensive, and scalable solar energy conversion is critical for overcoming challenges associated with greenhouse gas emission and climate change. Tandem solar cells that couple dissimilar materials, such as silicon and perovskites, are one possible route to high efficiencies at low cost. However, interfacial misalignment imposes defects and stability and toxicity issues of lead-containing perovskites drives research into alternatives. We explore non-traditional top absorbers including bismuth- or titanium-containing semiconductors as well as routes to connect to silicon using well-defined, organic linkers. The outcome of this research should yield strategies for inexpensive yet highly efficient and scalable tandem PV.","<iframe src=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRv4hHafqa4FUgJ7l7JeIvgfxICROc0ZGp-pF13iuOIe62vXM3Grtg4IVJjXqGlwA/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"" frameborder=""0"" width=""1280"" height=""749"" allowfullscreen=""true"" mozallowfullscreen=""true"" webkitallowfullscreen=""true""></iframe>"
,,,,Karen Royer,Dr. Gillian Smith,"Interactive Media and Game Design, PhD",Code Crafters,,"Code Crafters is a research project centered on a skilled adult population of quilters. We are investigating the connection between the practice of quilting and computational thinking. We are building an application that leverages the social nature of quilting and the desire quilters often demonstrate for improving their practice through continued learning opportunities. During a workshop that presents both quilt designs and the generative software, we create a scaffold through which quilters can explore computational thinking and computer science. We hope to supplement knowledge the quilters may already have in order to impact their confidence and self-efficacy. We hope to reach a diverse, sometimes underrepresented population and engage them in discussions about computers and computer science. These efforts have the potential for ongoing impact in their lives as well as the lives of their extended family members.","<iframe width=""100%"" height=""315"" src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21269&amp;authkey=AK8SZ6a3G1PgniQ&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
,,,,ML Tlachac,Dr. Elke Rundensteiner,"Data Science, PhD",Collecting Data to Screen for Student Mental Health,,"Depression is prevalent, especially among students. While universal screening is recommended, current screening surveys are too cumbersome. Thus, research has started exploring passively screening for depression with data collected with mobile apps. We developed and deployed mobile and web apps to collect data from students for instantaneous screening. Notably, we gathered depression survey score, demographics, text prompt, and recorded audio from over 300 undergraduate and graduate students. On the screening survey a score of 10 is the cutoff for depression and also the mean score of the student participants. This dataset will be valuable in training machine learning models to instantaneously perform passive mobile mental illness screening.","<iframe src=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSjH7yPzowxQf0k84c_kaUwU5siv1Aj8OHCEdRiDzThQ3i8EFX9zrYtC-QWZIPung/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"" frameborder=""0"" width=""1280"" height=""749"" allowfullscreen=""true"" mozallowfullscreen=""true"" webkitallowfullscreen=""true""></iframe>"
,,,,Sabine Hahn,Dr. Amity Manning,"Biology & Biotechnology, PhD",Epigenetic regulation of chromosome segregation,,"Dynamic regulation of chromatin structure is critical for a number of biological processes, including accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. Much of this regulation is accomplished through epigenetic mechanisms that involve the addition of chemical moieties to DNA itself, or the histone proteins that DNA is wrapped around. During cell division, epigenetic mechanisms influence the formation and function of distinct regions on DNA that are responsible for linking chromosomes to the mitotic spindle. Defects in this regulation corrupt the way attachments are made and can result in chromosome segregation errors. In cancer cells, segregation errors can promote tumor evolution by contributing to mobility, metastatic potential, or even resistance to therapeutics. I am characterizing the role of an epigenetic regulator known as Suv420 in regulating mitotic chromosome structure. Both gains and losses of Suv420 have been described in cancer contexts and a better understanding of the cell biological consequences of such changes will enhance our understanding of cancer biology.","<iframe src=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRWHaibf3cYwxbdLj2AzqPWqS6Ux0LJBLjVmNTREf_FLS_HbSRpxt1f5hqWFEnFZg/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"" frameborder=""0"" width=""1280"" height=""749"" allowfullscreen=""true"" mozallowfullscreen=""true"" webkitallowfullscreen=""true""></iframe>"
,,,,Teagan Bate,Dr. Kun-Ta Wu,"Physics, PhD",Self-organization and mixing of microtubule-kinesin active fluid in an activity gradient,,"Active fluid, composed of kinesin-driven extensile bundles of microtubules, consumes ATP locally to create a self-mixing flow. Mean speed of microtubule-kinesin active fluid was shown to be tunable by varying its components’ concentrations. Such tunability demonstrated the controllability of active fluid with uniform activity. However, how active fluid self-organizes when its activity is non-uniform remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized active fluid behavior and its associated mixing performance in an activity gradient. The activity gradient was created by imposing a temperature gradient because our previous work showed that microtubule-kinesin active fluid exhibited an Arrhenius response to temperature: Increasing temperature sped up active fluid flow, and thus, along a temperature gradient, active fluid flowed faster on one side and slower on the other, forming an activity gradient. We characterized how such a gradient influenced the mixing performance of active fluid in terms of mixing efficiency, stretching rate, and mean squared displacement, comparing with an activity-uniform sample. Our work suggests that applying an activity gradient can serve as a new in-situ method for controlling self-organization and mixing performance of microtubule-kinesin active fluid.","<iframe width=""100%"" height=""315"" src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21269&amp;authkey=AK8SZ6a3G1PgniQ&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
